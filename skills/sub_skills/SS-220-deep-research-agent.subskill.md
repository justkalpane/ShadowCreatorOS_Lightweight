# SUBSKILL SS-220 - Deep Research Agent

## SECTION 1: SKILL IDENTITY & OWNERSHIP
- Skill_ID: SS-220
- Canonical_Name: Deep Research Agent
- Archetype: integration
- Role_Type: PRIMARY_ROLE
- Owner_Director: Vyasa
- Domain: Research Intelligence

## SECTION 2: AUTHORITY MATRIX
- Can_Execute: domain-specific analysis, planning, optimization, and packet shaping
- Cannot_Execute: budget override, policy override, unauthorized namespace mutation
- Requires_Approval: premium route invocation when route budget/policy gates require it
- Escalation_Required: unresolved contradictions, auth/callback failures, critical quality violations
- Veto_Authority: NO

## SECTION 3: READS (INPUT VEINS)
### 3.1 Primary Inputs
- dossier_id:string
- research_brief:object
- query_scope:object

### 3.2 Provider Context
  - gemini_provider
  - openrouter_api
  - ollama_local

## SECTION 4: WRITES (OUTPUT VEINS)
- artifact_family:deep-research-agent_packet
- research_graph:object
- evidence_index:array
- status:success|failed|degraded
- write_target: dossier.subskills.deep-research-agent (append_only)
- write_target: se_packet_index (append_only)

## SECTION 5: EXECUTION FLOW & ALGORITHM
1. Validate input packet fields and route legality context.
2. Execute domain intelligence transform using platform/runtime constraints.
3. Apply quality, cost, and governance-aware optimization passes.
4. Validate output contract and emit deterministic error semantics if degraded.
5. Append output packet and lineage-safe dossier patch.

## SECTION 6: SCORING FRAMEWORK
- quality_score (0-100)
- confidence_score (0-100)
- cost_efficiency_score (0-100)
- governance_compliance_score (0-100)
- acceptance_rule: governance_compliance_score >= 90 and quality_score >= 75

## SECTION 7: BEST PRACTICES
- Build research plans with hypothesis trees and source diversity targets
- Prioritize primary sources before synthesized summaries
- Capture citation evidence index with confidence tagging
- Separate exploratory findings from publication-safe findings
- Attach contradiction candidates for downstream verification

## SECTION 8: EXECUTION RULES & CONSTRAINTS
- Enforce patch-only mutation law for dossier updates.
- Preserve evidence/provenance traceability in all outputs.
- Respect route_id, cost_tier, and policy_verdict constraints.
- Keep outputs deterministic and replay-safe.

## SECTION 9: FAILURE MODES & RECOVERY
- no_reliable_sources -> escalate WF-900
- source_fetch_timeout -> retry with narrowed query bands
- evidence_index_empty -> return degraded packet
- policy_restricted_topic -> governance escalation

## SECTION 10: TOOL POLICY
- Allowed_Tools: n8n workflow nodes, provider adapters, packet validators, local runtime utilities
- Forbidden_Tools: destructive mutation, unauthorized secrets operations, undeclared network paths
- Secret_Scope: local secure store and approved secrets manager only

## SECTION 11: N8N + OLLAMA PLUGGABILITY
- n8n_consumer_workflows:
  - WF-100
  - CWF-110
  - CWF-140
- ollama_reasoning_injection: true
- packet_contract: deep-research-agent_packet
- replay_path: WF-021
- escalation_path: WF-900

## SECTION 12: VALIDATION & ACCEPTANCE
- Must emit status, artifact_family, payload, and provider_execution_summary.
- Must include deterministic error_code for failed/degraded outcomes.
- Must satisfy downstream field contracts before handoff.

## MAC-06.2B UNIVERSAL COMPONENT CONTRACT UPGRADE

This append-only block upgrades this component to the MAC-06.2B universal component contract standard. Existing behavior above remains intact; this block adds required typed inputs, outputs, pointers, validation, fallback, and lineage expectations.

component_name: Ss 220 Deep Research Agent.Subskill
route_families: [lineage_summary, approval_gate]
activation_triggers: route_family in [trend_research, topic_discovery, quality_gate, lineage_summary] or explicit registry selection; mark approval_gate_profile only when route_family is unknown.

fallback_behavior: NEEDS_HUMAN_REVIEW if upstream packet IDs or approval choices are missing.
lineage_fields: [upstream_packet_ids, downstream_packet_ids, decision_log, evidence_paths]
provider_boundary: provider_execution_allowed=false; approval may authorize future execution; default is no provider/media/n8n execution
status_limits: May not claim production-ready, onboarded, provider-called, media-created, or n8n-executed without external proof.
human_approval_points: [approve, revise_segment, regenerate_media, reject]
