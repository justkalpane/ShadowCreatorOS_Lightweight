# SKL-PHASE_1C_CONDITIONAL_RESEARCH-M-027-NUANCE_CAPTURE_ENGINE Test Definition

## Purpose

This markdown file is the external test definition required for M-027 by the broad registry validator. It mirrors the deterministic tests declared in the source skill contract so registry closure can be checked without starting n8n, calling providers, or generating media.

## Contract Anchors

- skill_id: M-027
- source_skill_contract: skills/script_intelligence_army/M-027-seo-architect.skill.md
- output_packet_family: m027_packet
- schema_ref: schemas/packets/m027_packet.schema.json
- producer_workflow: CWF-140
- escalation_path: WF-900
- replay_path: WF-021

## PASS Conditions

- The source skill keeps the 12-section contract template in exact order.
- The source skill declares at least 18 deterministic TEST-M-027-### cases.
- The skill emits only its schema-bound packet family and validates against the declared schema reference.
- Missing inputs, schema failures, or governance failures route to WF-900.
- Replay or remodify requests route to WF-021.
- Dossier and packet index mutation remains append-only.

## FAIL Conditions

- The source skill loses its 12-section template.
- The source skill has fewer than 18 deterministic test cases.
- The output packet family or schema reference drifts from registry parity.
- The skill bypasses WF-900 on hard failure or WF-021 on replay.
- The skill performs destructive mutation or untyped packet emission.
